Sydney’s research integrates nutritional ecology, insect immunology, and life history theory to investigate how resource availability and population density shape physiological tradeoffs in traits such as reproduction, migration, and immune defense in locusts. Using both laboratory and field approaches, she examines how factors like nutrition and population density influence immune responses and allocation to life history traits. She aims to continue conducting research at the intersection of insect physiology and agricultural pest management to develop sustainable strategies that support growers, protect crops, and promote global food security.

When she isnt in the lab, you can find her hiking and enjoying the biodiversity of the Sonoran desert.

You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
